# Control Structures

* Allow us to control how a script executes
* Run specifed code based on conditions

## if ... then ... fi

If statements execute code based on a conditional expression.

```bash
if [[ ... ]]
then
    script
else
    script
fi

if condition; then script; fi
```

## while .., do .. done
